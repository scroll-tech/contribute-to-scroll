# Contribution Description 📝
- I recomend and suggest to have the Paymaster Feature like Zksyce does. I think Scroll and Zksyce both have quite similar fundamental, so I think for developer, it is not that hard to integrate this into Scroll.
- The reason that I suggest having Paymaster (Users have choice to choose the gas token to pay for fee) is :
  1. It can create a good experience to users. They can have choice on what ever token they want to use to pay gas without ETH. They can choose to avoide holding a lot of ETH that can have price changes and slippage. They can just hold stable coins and be able to use this to pay gas.
  2. It can be a great marketing campaign encouraging users to use the chain or even interacting with the chain more by having a fee reduction if they use other tokens.
  3. tbh, Scroll has quite a higher fee compared to other chains; therefore, with the integration of fee rebase campaign by using other tokens of their choice ex. using stable coins get 10% fee rebase or using Scroll Native token (if we have one), we cannot only create more utility to our token, but we can also make people to have a higher great experience while using the chain
