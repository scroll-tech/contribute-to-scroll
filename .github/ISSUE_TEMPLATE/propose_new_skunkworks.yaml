        General idea of Skunkworks as per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) is:
          
        > The designation 'skunk works' or 'skunkworks' is widely used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describeÂ **a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, with the task of working on advanced or secret projects**\n
        
        **But what is it for us?**
        
        Skunkworks are Innovative ideas that inspire developers, explore new use cases, and illustrate best practices on Scroll.
        
        Every time you feel like something would be cool to exist related to Scroll, ZK, Developer Tooling etc. post it here.
        If you ever feel like itâ€™s too crazy, remember, zkEVM was crazy idea just a few years ago ðŸ™‚
