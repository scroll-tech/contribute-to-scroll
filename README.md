## About Scroll

Scroll is an open source zkEVM Layer 2 that helps scaling Ethereum. Scroll is bytecode equivalent with the EVM, which makes possible native compatibility for existing Ethereum application and tools. You can learn more about Scroll in [the docs](https://guide.scroll.io/).

Scroll has three technical principles that all contributions should follow:

**Scalability:**

Scroll processes transactions off-chain, and posts succinct proofs of correctness on-chain. This results in higher throughput and lower costs in comparison to the Ethereum base layer.


**EVM Equivalence:**

Developing on Scroll feels the same as developing on Ethereum. Any EVM-compatible smart contract can be effortlessly deployed to Scroll’s network.


**### Security:**

Scroll’s protocol is currently undergoing multiple third-party audits to ensure security. Scroll also values transparency and is working to build its platform openly and in collaboration with the community.
